    <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://taubmancollege.umich.edu/urbanplanning">Urban and Regional Planning Program at the University of Michigan</a>. I study housing and neighborhood dynamics under conditions of decline and planning in cities that have experienced steep and sustained population loss. My dissertation examines what happened to the large number of properties repossessed by federal agencies and financial institutions in the wake of the wake of the foreclosure crisis in Detroit. My dissertation research is supported by the <a href="http://home.isr.umich.edu/education/fellowships-awards/the-robert-kahn-fellowship-for-the-scientific-study-of-social-issues/">Robert Kahn Fellowship for the Scientific Study of Social Problems</a>, awarded by the Institute for Social Research. I also collaborate with UM professors Margaret Dewar, June Manning Thomas, and Lan Deng on <a href="http://carss.umich.edu/projects/evolving-projects/detroit-foreclosure-crisis/">research examining the efforts of neighborhood-based organizations</a> in combating blight and stabilizing housing market conditions in Detroit neighborhood hit hard by the mortgage foreclosure crisis. This research is supported by a data grant from CoreLogic. </p>
<p>Since 2012, I have helped organize the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~detsch/">Detroit School of Urban Studies</a>, a series of lectures and conversations organized around the principle of discussing the contributions of Detroit-based research to urban theory. I am also the current coordinator of <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/ibug/home">IBUG</a>, the Interdisciplinary Committee on Organization Studies (ICOS) Big Data Users Group. Through my research, I have become advanced in the use of the Python programming language for data collection and analysis. I am also an avid user and supporter of open source software for research, including <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a>, <a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a> and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">R Studio</a>. </p>
<p>I earned my Master of Urban and Regional Planning degree from the University of Florida, where I assisted in the development of the <a href="http://www.shimberg.ufl.edu/fl_housingSuitableModel.html">Housing Suitability Model</a>, a GIS-based tool for identifying locations suitable for affordable housing development and preservation. </p>
<p>I am from the Queen City, Buffalo, NY. I spent several years teaching guitar lessons and playing in bands in and around Buffalo before being bitten by the bug for academia. I currently live in Ypsilanti, MI, a lovely little city where every business has a name or product associated with the <a href="http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1902325,00.html">B-24 Bomber</a>.   </p>
